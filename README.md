This is a redesign of my grade 11 Emerging Technologies website. It's a simple website to inform you of all tech-related things!

***Purpose:***
The first Emerging Technologies website was made with a lot of assistance from my teacher, so I wanted to see if I was able to create a website entirely on my own (other than help from the internet every now and then!).

Through building this website, I also hoped to strengthen my problem-solving skills, increase my knowledge of HTML, CSS, & JavaScript, and learn how to create some of the cool features I've seen in previous websites.

It might not be the coolest looking website, but I'm proud of it because it's my first independent project. I will use this project as motivation of what I am able to create with the help of technology.
